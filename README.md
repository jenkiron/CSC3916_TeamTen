# CSC3916_HW4

This HW4 is complete and working as I understood the assignment. My GET reviews returns all of the movies
but only adds on the review for movies with reviews. At first I had it where it only showed movies
with reviews but after re-reading the assignment I believe this is the way the assignment
laid it out. If I'm wrong, let me know and i can re-submit.
